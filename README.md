Analyzing-the-Cost-of-Living-in-the-United-States

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the total cost of living across U.S. regions based on multiple socio-economic factors such as housing, food, transportation, taxes, healthcare, and childcare. It includes a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit for real-time predictions.

Overview

Accurate prediction of cost of living is essential for:
- Individuals making relocation decisions
- Businesses determining compensation
- Policymakers addressing regional disparities

By leveraging a dataset of over 31,000 records, this project identifies key cost drivers and applies robust predictive models under standard, noisy, and non-linear data conditions.

Features

- **Interactive Web App**: Streamlit interface for real-time cost prediction
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes missing value imputation, feature scaling, and encoding
- **Feature Selection**: Uses correlation analysis and Random Forest importance
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluates Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- **Robust Prediction Engine**: Gradient Boosting selected as the final model for its superior accuracy and robustness

Machine Learning Models

| Model              | RÂ² Score | MSE               | Notes                                 |
|-------------------|----------|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Linear Regression  | 1.00     | 0.00              | Overfits clean data, poor on noise     |
| Ridge Regression   | 1.00     | 0.17              | Good for clean, linear data            |
| Decision Trees     | 0.95     | 23,802,981.50     | High variance, prone to overfitting    |
| Random Forest      | 1.00     | 971,309.96        | Strong but less robust than GBM        |
| Gradient Boosting  | 1.00     | ~2M (robust)      | Best accuracy, handles non-linearity   |

System Architecture

- **Backend**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Frontend**: Streamlit for user interaction and visualization
- **Deployment**: Local/Cloud hosting of Streamlit app

Getting Started
